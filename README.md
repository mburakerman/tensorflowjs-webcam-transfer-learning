# Tensorflowjs Webcam Transfer Learning
This example shows you how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer learning.

> In this example, we'll use a pretrained MobileNet model and train another model using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 3 different classes from the webcam defined by the user.


### 🔮 Usage
After enabling your webcam, set your position and than click the button a few time until probability rate is 100%.
Make this for left, middle and right.

That's is. Have fun!
