# Tensorflowjs Webcam Transfer Learning
This example shows you how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer learning.

> In this example, we'll use a pretrained MobileNet model and train another model using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 3 different classes from the webcam defined by the user.

### 💡 Usage
After enabling your webcam, you can train left, middle and right positions with your webcam.

Set your position and tahn click the button a few time until probability rate is 100%.(make this for left, middle and right)

That's is. Have fun!
